      <h2> Micromouse Simulator App </h2>

      <p>
        Matt Burns, ’20 and I were on the same IEEE SAC team to write the software for a micromouse. While waiting on
        other
        members to construct the robot’s physical body, we developed many simple Python programs in order to test
        multiple
        implementations of the path finding algorithm. However, those programs lack a graphical interface; all outputs
        could
        only be viewed through the aesthetically unpleasing black-and-white console. Furthermore, every implementation
        required
        a whole new Python script. We did not have a logical interface through which we could simply execute the desired
        algorithm without rewriting the script from scratch. I proposed to Matt that I develop a stand-alone computer
        application as a side project to solve these problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020, we could no longer physically run the robot, without access to the
        eight-by-eight square foot maze on campus. The unfavorable situation motivated my effort even further. After one
        month,
        the Micromouse Simulator was a functional app for our own use. The app is based on the Python Tkinter library.
        It
        possesses a minimalistic interface with a minimal number of buttons and displays. It does not require a separate
        Python
        installation on the computer. All instructions for the app are packaged together with the app itself. Users can
        write a
        one-file script using the given template, which significantly reduces the time needed for a new algorithm’s
        development,
        visualization, and testing. Users can use the same template to write another short script for a different
        algorithm.
        Moreover, they would be able to interactively select which algorithm to test from within the app. There is a
        built-in
        random maze generator which, as its name suggests, randomly generates a maze so that the users can test the
        algorithm
        against all possible maze configurations. When a user presses the “Start Navigation” button, a diamond shape,
        which
        represents the micromouse will start to move according to the user’s algorithm, as if it is the real micromouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Spring 2020 semester was over, I thought the app might also be very useful for students of ENGR 150 in
        which
        students were introduced to, and competed in the Micromouse project, so I continued the app’s development to
        suit that
        purpose. As of now, the app’s “Custom Mode” allows user to design, save, and retrieve their own maze designs.
        That means
        that anyone can test their algorithm against a specific maze configuration to determine whether the algorithm is
        adequate for every possible situation. On the other hand, professors now have a means to digitally design the
        maze for
        the ENGR 150 competition if they choose to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the scope of the Micromouse project, the development of the app encouraged me to learn more about the
        programming
        language Python, algorithms, and data structures. For example, I had to determine the best presentation of a
        sixteen-by-sixteen maze that is comprehensible for a human being, and efficient for a computer. Obviously, I
        also
        further honed my skills as an app developer. In fact, a lot of the new knowledge I learned was reviewed and
        elaborated
        upon in my current computer science class, Data Structures and Algorithms.
