      <h2> Gesture Controlled Lock </h2>

      <p>
        Over summer break, I assembled and led a team to build a contact-less lock that uses basic hand gestures to enter the passcode to open a garage door. It is like a keypad lock that replaces pressing buttons with touch-less gestures, which is especially important now during the COVID-19 Coronavirus pandemic when touching objects is discouraged.
        <br><br>It is also extremely easy to install. The user just needs to stick it behind a window near the garage and plug it in. Since the device is completely indoors, the user also does not have to worry about the device being tampered with or failing due to the weather, such as extreme heat, cold, or humidity. This is made possible with the use of Pyroelectric Infrared Sensors, which have the ability to see through glass.
        <br><br>The hand gestures are quite simple. The first thing the user needs to do is to wake up the device by waving their hand in front of the right sensor. After this, they can give the hand signals to open the garage door. A swipe is a "1" while a single hand over the left sensor is a "0." If the entered binary code matches the code saved in the device, the device will open the door.
